# Auto-download
Hi guys, 
This is just a project that I made for fun...Try it and tell me what can I improve.

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
1. Must be using a chromium based browser...or else you have to change few lines in the code.
2. Find the version of ur browser and download the chromedriver accordingly as things might change in future.

<h2>Setup</h2>
1. Specify the path for chrome driver. 
2. Specify the path for browser .exe/.dmg file.
3. If you are using any download manager...Download its .crx file and specify the path for that. As a matter of fact I am using free download manager(fdm). I recommend using one as browser will close after fetching ur file.

<h2>Note</h2>
Note there are 2 website as of today one for Kdramas/Cdramas and all and one for hollywood and bollywood movies...
For dramacool.py u have to fill the captcha if there is one...as for movieflix.py u dont have to do anything.
