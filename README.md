# Auto-download
Hi guys, 
This is just a project that I made for fun...Try it and tell me what can I improve.

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
1. Must be using a chromium based browser...or else you have to change few lines in the code.<br>
2. Find the version of ur browser and download the chromedriver accordingly as things might change in future.

<h2>Setup</h2>
1. Specify the path for chrome driver.<br>
2. Specify the path for browser .exe/.dmg file.<br>
3. If you are using any download manager...Download its .crx file and specify the path for that. As a matter of fact I am using free download manager(fdm). I recommend using one as browser will close after fetching ur file.

<h2>Note</h2>
1. There are 2 website as of today one for Kdramas/Cdramas and all and one for hollywood and bollywood movies...<br>
2. For dramacool.py u have to fill the captcha if there is one...as for movieflix.py u dont have to do anything.<br>
3. For best experience run code using termial or cmd.<br>
4. If you are using mac replace this 'os.system('cls')' with 'os.system('clear')'. <br>
5. When we dramacool.py browser may open a captcha code just solve the captcha and verify, then just go to where u r running ur program just hit enter...ðŸ˜‰.
